**_NOTICE_** We provide here two example sets of SEDs, mostly for the purposes of testing and exploring.  It is strongly encouraged that users carefully consider which SEDs to use, and seek more qualified SEDs for their problem.  Results can depend significantly on the SEDs used (as it is akin to model selection), and will vary depending on the data properties.

The provided seds are publicly available, *please* use proper citation.
